This is a React app in which a user can enter the name of a movie and get all the associated titles. For example, if the user enters "Star Wars", then information for all of the movies in the Star Wars franchise is returned. To access the information, I fetched the data from the Open Movie Database API.

The app is optimized for a mobile device, but, via media queries, can also be displayed on a desktop monitor.
